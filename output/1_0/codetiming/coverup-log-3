You are an expert Python test-driven developer.
The code below, extracted from codetiming/_timer.py, module codetiming._timer, does not achieve full coverage:
when tested, branch 50->62 does not execute.
Create a new pytest test function that executes these missing lines/branches, always making
sure that the new test is correct and indeed improves coverage.
Always send entire Python test scripts when proposing a new test or correcting one you
previously proposed.
Be sure to include assertions in the test that verify any applicable postconditions.
Please also make VERY SURE to clean up after the test, so as not to affect other tests;
use 'pytest-mock' if appropriate.
Write as little top-level code as possible, and in particular do not include any top-level code
calling into pytest.main or the test itself.
Respond ONLY with the Python code enclosed in backticks, without any explanation.

            @dataclass

                    if self._start_time is None:
                        raise TimerError("Timer is not running. Use .start() to start it")
            
                    # Calculate elapsed time
                    self.last = time.perf_counter() - self._start_time
                    self._start_time = None
