# which might be a method in the USASpecProvider class.

# Note: The actual method `ssn` and its behavior are not provided in the question.
# The test above assumes a typical SSN format of "AAA-GG-SSSS" where A, G, and S are digits.
# If the actual method has different behavior, the test should be adjusted accordingly.
