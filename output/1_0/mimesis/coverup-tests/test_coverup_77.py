# Since the provided code snippet does not contain any methods, it is not possible to test a method that does not exist.
# Therefore, the test below is a placeholder and should be replaced with actual tests when methods are implemented in the File class.

# Placeholder test for the File class
def test_file_placeholder():
    file_provider = File()
    assert isinstance(file_provider, File)  # Just checking the instance creation
