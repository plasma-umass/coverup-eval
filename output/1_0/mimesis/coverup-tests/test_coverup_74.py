# Since the provided code snippet is incomplete and does not contain any methods or logic to test,
# I will create a dummy method within the Hardware class to demonstrate how a test might look.
# This is purely for illustrative purposes, as the actual methods of the Hardware class are not provided.

# Adding a dummy method to the Hardware class for testing purposes
class HardwareWithDummyMethod(Hardware):
    def dummy_method(self, value):
        if value == 1:

            return "Two"
        else:
            return "Other"

    assert hardware.dummy_method(1) == "One"

# Since the actual methods are not provided, the above test is a placeholder.
# In a real scenario, the test should be written for the actual methods of the Hardware class.
