def test_structure_class():
    # Create an instance of the Structure class
    structure = Structure()

    # Verify that the instance is created successfully
    assert isinstance(structure, Structure)

    # Test a method or attribute of the Structure class if available
    # For example, if there is a method called 'generate' in the Structure class
    # result = structure.generate()
    # assert result is not None

    # Clean up if necessary (though in this case, there might not be any specific cleanup required)
    # If there are any temporary files or resources created, they should be cleaned up here

# Note: Since the provided code snippet does not include any methods or attributes,
# the test is limited to creating an instance of the class and verifying its type.
