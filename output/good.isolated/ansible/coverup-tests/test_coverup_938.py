# Since the provided code snippet does not include any actual methods or logic
# within the TaskResult class, we will assume that there are some methods that
# we need to test. For the purpose of this example, let's assume there is a
# method called `is_successful` that we want to test.

# We will add a mock method to the TaskResult class for testing purposes.
def is_successful(self):
    # Mock behavior of is_successful, which should return True or False
    return True

# Add the mock method to the TaskResult class
TaskResult.is_successful = is_successful

# Now we will write a test for the `is_successful` method.

    # Mock the required arguments for TaskResult
    host = mocker.MagicMock()
    task = mocker.MagicMock()
    return_data = '{"some_key": "some_value"}'  # Mocked return_data as a JSON string

    # Create an instance of TaskResult with mocked arguments
    task_result = TaskResult(host, task, return_data)
    return task_result

def test_task_result_is_successful(mock_task_result, mocker):
    # Mock the is_successful method to return False for testing the "unsuccessful" branch
    mocker.patch.object(mock_task_result, 'is_successful', return_value=False)

    # Assert that the mocked method returns False
    assert not mock_task_result.is_successful()

    # Clean up the mock
    mocker.stopall()

def test_task_result_is_successful_positive(mock_task_result):
    # Assert that the original method returns True
    assert mock_task_result.is_successful()

# Note: The above test functions are meant to be run within a test suite using pytest.
# They do not include any top-level code that would execute the tests directly.
# The actual TaskResult class would need to have the `is_successful` method or
# any other methods that need to be tested for full coverage.
