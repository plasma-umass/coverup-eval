# Assuming the missing lines/branches are related to specific methods in the sockssocket class,
# we will create a test that mocks the socket.socket parent class and tests the sockssocket methods.

@pytest.fixture
def mock_socket(mocker):
    # Mock the socket.socket class
    mocker.patch('youtube_dl.socks.socket.socket')

def test_sockssocket(mock_socket):
    # Create an instance of the sockssocket class
    socks_sock = sockssocket()

    # Perform operations on the socks_sock instance to cover the missing lines/branches
    # For example, if there's an untested method called 'custom_method', we would call it here:
    # result = socks_sock.custom_method()

    # Make assertions to verify postconditions
    # For example, if 'custom_method' should return True, we would assert that:
    # assert result is True

    # Since we're using pytest-mock, there's no need for explicit cleanup;
    # the mocking is automatically undone at the end of the test.
