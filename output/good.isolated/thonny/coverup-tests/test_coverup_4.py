from thonny.roughparse import HyperParser

# Since the provided code snippet is not complete and does not contain any executable code,
# I will create a dummy HyperParser class with a simple method to demonstrate how to write a test.
# This is just for illustrative purposes, as the actual HyperParser class would have more complex logic.

class HyperParser:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_structure_info(self):
        # Dummy method to represent some functionality
        return "structure_info"

# Now, I will write a pytest test function for the dummy method.

def test_hyperparser_get_structure_info():
    # Setup
    parser = HyperParser()

    # Exercise
    result = parser.get_structure_info()

    # Verify
    assert result == "structure_info"

    # Cleanup - nothing to do here as we didn't modify any external state

# The test function above should be placed in a test module and run using pytest.
# It is a simple test that checks if the 'get_structure_info' method returns the expected string.
