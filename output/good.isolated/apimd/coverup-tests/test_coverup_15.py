# Assuming the missing coverage is due to not instantiating the Resolver class
# and not using any of its methods, we will create a test that does just that.
# We will also provide the required 'root' and 'alias' arguments.

def test_resolver_instantiation_and_transformation():
    # Create an instance of the Resolver with dummy 'root' and 'alias'
    resolver = Resolver('root', 'alias')

    # Create a simple AST node to transform
    node = parse("x = 1")

    # Transform the node using the resolver
    new_node = resolver.visit(node)

    # Assert that the transformation does not change the node
    # (since we have not defined any specific transformation rules)
    assert new_node == node

    # Clean up is not necessary here as we are not modifying any external state
