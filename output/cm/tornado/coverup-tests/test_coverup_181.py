# Since the provided code snippet does not contain any executable lines or branches,

# for the given code. However, I will provide a template for a test that can be
# expanded once there is more functionality within the TCPClient class.

    # with patch('tornado.tcpclient.TCPClient.connect') as mock_connect:

    #     tcp_client = TCPClient()
    #     tcp_client.connect('localhost', 8888)

    # Cleanup code would go here if there were any resources to clean up
    # For now, there is nothing to clean up after the test

# Note: The above test does not actually improve coverage for the provided code snippet,
# as there are no executable lines in the TCPClient class. This is just a template
# to be used once the class has some functionality to test.
