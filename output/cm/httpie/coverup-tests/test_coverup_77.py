# Assuming the PluginManager class has more code that we need to test
# but only the provided snippet is shown, we will create a test case
# that targets the initialization of the PluginManager class.

def test_plugin_manager_initialization(mocker):
    # Mocking any external dependencies if necessary
    # For example, if PluginManager interacts with file system or network
    # we should mock these to ensure our test is isolated and repeatable
    # Since no external dependencies are shown, we'll proceed without mocking

    # Test initialization of PluginManager
    plugin_manager = PluginManager()

    # Assertions to verify postconditions
    # Since no behavior is shown, we'll just check the type for now
    assert isinstance(plugin_manager, PluginManager)

    # Clean up after test
    # Since we haven't created any external resources, there's nothing to clean up
    # If there were external resources, we would clean them up here

    # If the PluginManager modifies any global state, we would need to restore it
    # Since no such behavior is shown, we'll assume there's nothing to restore

# Note: The provided code snippet is incomplete and does not contain any behavior.
# The test above assumes that the PluginManager class can be instantiated and is a list subclass.
# If there are more methods or properties, additional tests should be written to cover those.
