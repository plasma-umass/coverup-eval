def test_box_behavior():
    # Setup: create an instance of Box with some data
    box = Box(42)

    # Exercise and Verify: perform operations and assert postconditions
    # This is where you would test the actual behavior of the Box class
    # For example, if Box has a method `get` to retrieve the stored value:
    # assert box.get() == 42

    # Cleanup: nothing to clean up in this case
    pass  # Replace with actual cleanup code if necessary
