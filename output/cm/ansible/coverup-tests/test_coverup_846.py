# Since the provided code snippet does not include any methods or logic to test,
# and is only a class definition, we will assume that there are some methods
# inside the LinuxVirtual class that we need to test for coverage.
# For the purpose of this example, let's assume there is a method `get_virtualization_type`
# that we need to test. Since the actual implementation is not provided, we will mock it.

# We will use pytest-mock to mock any external dependencies or methods.

        return linux.LinuxVirtual(module=mock_module)

    def test_linux_virtual_platform(self, linux_virtual):
        # Testing the platform attribute of the LinuxVirtual class.
        assert linux_virtual.platform == 'Linux'

# Note: The actual test would depend on the real methods and logic inside the LinuxVirtual class.
# Since the provided code snippet does not contain any executable code, the above test is purely hypothetical.
