# Since the provided code snippet is incomplete and does not contain any executable lines or branches,
# I will create a dummy test function that instantiates the PlaybookExecutor class with mocked arguments.
# This test does not improve coverage as the provided code snippet does not contain any logic to test.
# However, I will proceed with the assumption that the actual PlaybookExecutor class has more code that can be tested.

# Note: The actual test would depend on the real implementation of PlaybookExecutor and its methods.
# The above test is a placeholder and does not improve coverage for the provided code snippet.
