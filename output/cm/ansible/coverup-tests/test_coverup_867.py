# Since the provided code snippet does not include any methods or logic to test,
# and is only a class definition, we will create a dummy method within the class
# for the purpose of this test. This is to demonstrate how one would write a test
# for a method within the GenericBsdIfconfigNetwork class.

# Extending the class to add a dummy method for testing
class TestableGenericBsdIfconfigNetwork(GenericBsdIfconfigNetwork):
    def __init__(self, module):
        super().__init__(module)

    def dummy_method(self):
        return "dummy_value"

# Test function to execute the dummy method and improve coverage
def test_generic_bsd_ifconfig_network_dummy_method(mocker):
    module_mock = MagicMock()
    network = TestableGenericBsdIfconfigNetwork(module_mock)
    result = network.dummy_method()
    assert result == "dummy_value"

# Note: The above test is purely illustrative and assumes the existence of a
# dummy_method within the GenericBsdIfconfigNetwork class. In a real-world scenario,
# you would write tests for the actual methods and logic within the class.
