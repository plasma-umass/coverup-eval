# Since the provided code snippet does not contain any executable lines or methods,
# we cannot create a test that improves coverage for the given code.
# The class HPUXNetwork only contains a docstring and class variables.
# To create a meaningful test, we would need additional methods or logic within the class.

# However, we can create a dummy test that instantiates the class to ensure that
# the class definition itself is covered.

def test_hpux_network_instantiation():
    # Creating a mock module to pass as the required argument to HPUXNetwork
    mock_module = MagicMock()

    # Instantiating the HPUXNetwork class with the mock module
    network = HPUXNetwork(module=mock_module)

    # Assertions to verify postconditions (none can be made with the current class definition)
    assert network.platform == 'HP-UX'

# Note: Since the HPUXNetwork class does not have any executable code or side effects,
# there is no need for cleanup after the test. The test does not affect the environment
# or other tests. If the class had external dependencies or created side effects, we would
# use fixtures or the mocker to ensure proper cleanup.
