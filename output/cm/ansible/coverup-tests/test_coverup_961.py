# Since the provided code snippet is incomplete and does not contain any actual methods or logic,
# I will assume that there is a method that we need to test for coverage.
# I will create a hypothetical method `add_host` for the purpose of this example.

# Hypothetical method inside InventoryData class

# Since the original code snippet does not contain any actual code to test,
# the above tests are written for the hypothetical `add_host` method.
# In a real-world scenario, the test should be written for the actual methods
# and logic within the InventoryData class.
