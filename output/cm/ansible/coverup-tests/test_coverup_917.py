# Since the provided code snippet is not complete and does not include any functionality to test,
# I will create a dummy test function that patches a hypothetical method within AdHocCLI
# that we want to test for coverage. This is just an illustrative example.

@pytest.fixture
def adhoc_cli_instance():
    # Setup code for creating an instance of AdHocCLI with a dummy argument to avoid ValueError
    cli_instance = AdHocCLI(['dummy_arg'])
    yield cli_instance
    # Teardown code if necessary

def test_adhoc_cli_method(adhoc_cli_instance):
    # Since the 'execute' method does not exist in the provided AdHocCLI class,
    # we will add it dynamically for the purpose of this test.
    adhoc_cli_instance.execute = MagicMock()

    # Call the method we are testing
    adhoc_cli_instance.execute()

    # Assert that the method was called
    adhoc_cli_instance.execute.assert_called_once()

    # Assert any postconditions if applicable
    # For example, if 'execute' should change some state, we would check that here
    # assert adhoc_cli_instance.some_state == expected_value

# Note: The actual test would depend on the real methods and logic within AdHocCLI.
# Since the provided code snippet does not contain any actionable code, the above test is purely illustrative.
