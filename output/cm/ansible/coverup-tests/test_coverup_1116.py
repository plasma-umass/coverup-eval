# Assuming the PluginLoadContext is a standalone class within the same module
# and not a nested class within PluginLoader.
# The actual missing lines/branches are not provided, so I will create a generic test
# that instantiates the PluginLoadContext.

# Here is a corrected test assuming PluginLoadContext is a standalone class
def test_plugin_load_context():
    # Setup
    # Assuming PluginLoadContext has an __init__ that can be called without arguments
    plugin_load_context = PluginLoadContext()

    # Exercise and Verify
    # Assuming there's a method or property to test within PluginLoadContext
    # Replace 'method_or_property' with the actual method/property name
    # assert plugin_load_context.method_or_property == expected_value

    # Cleanup
    # No cleanup necessary if no external state is changed

# Since the actual PluginLoadContext class is not provided, the test cannot be fully implemented.
# The above test is a template based on the given error message and the assumption that
# PluginLoadContext is not an attribute of PluginLoader.
