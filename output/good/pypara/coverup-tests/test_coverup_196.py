# Assuming Amount is a class that has a constructor that takes a Decimal
# and Posting is a class that has an 'amount' attribute of type Amount.
# These would need to be imported or defined for the test to work.
# For the purpose of this example, I'll define minimal stubs here:

class Amount:
    def __init__(self, value: Decimal):
        self.value = value

class Posting:
    def __init__(self, amount: Amount):
        self.amount = amount

# Assuming that LedgerEntry requires 'posting', 'ledger', and 'balance' as arguments,
# and that 'balance' is also of type Amount.
# I'll add a stub for 'ledger' and update the test accordingly.

class Ledger:  # Stub for the Ledger class
    pass

def test_ledger_entry_amount():
    # Setup
    amount_value = Decimal('100.00')
    amount = Amount(amount_value)
    posting = Posting(amount)
    ledger = Ledger()  # Create a stub instance of Ledger
    balance = Amount(amount_value)  # Assuming balance is also an Amount for this example
    ledger_entry = LedgerEntry(posting=posting, ledger=ledger, balance=balance)

    # Exercise
    result = ledger_entry.amount

    # Verify
    assert result == amount, "LedgerEntry.amount should return the correct Amount instance"
    assert result.value == amount_value, "The Amount instance should have the correct value"

    # Cleanup
    # No cleanup required for this test as no external resources or stateful systems are affected
