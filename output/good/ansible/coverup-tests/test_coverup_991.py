# Assuming the CronTab class has more context that is not provided here,
# and that it is part of a larger module that interacts with crontab files.
# The following test is designed to check the do_remove_env method.

def test_do_remove_env(mocker):
    # Setup: Create a mock for the CronTab class
    cron_mock = mocker.MagicMock(spec=CronTab)
    
    # Define the lines and decl to be passed to the do_remove_env method
    lines = ["SHELL=/bin/bash", "PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin", "MAILTO=root"]
    decl = "MAILTO"
    
    # Call the do_remove_env method
    result = CronTab.do_remove_env(cron_mock, lines, decl)
    
    # Assertions: Check that the result is None as the method does not return anything
    assert result is None
    
    # Cleanup: No cleanup required as we are using a mock and not modifying any real crontab files
