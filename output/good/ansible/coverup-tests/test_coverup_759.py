    # For example, if there's an uncovered method named 'uncovered_method':
    # result = inventory_module.uncovered_method()

    # Make assertions to verify postconditions
    # assert result == expected_result

    # Cleanup if necessary
    # This is just a placeholder, actual cleanup will depend on what the test does
    # mocker.stopall()

    # Placeholder assertion to prevent IndentationError due to empty function body

# Note: The actual missing lines/branches are not provided in the question.
# The test function above is a template and should be filled with actual test logic
# based on the specific methods and lines that are not covered by existing tests.
