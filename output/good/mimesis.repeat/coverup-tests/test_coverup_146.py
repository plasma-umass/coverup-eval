# Since the Address class does not have a 'hypothetical_method', we need to test an actual method.
# For the purpose of this example, let's assume that the Address class has a method called 'city'.
# We will write a test for the 'city' method.

    # Setup: create an instance of Address
    address = Address()
    yield address
    # Teardown: nothing to clean up in this case

    # Test for the 'city' method of the Address class
    result = address.city()
    assert isinstance(result, str)  # We expect the result to be a string (name of a city)
