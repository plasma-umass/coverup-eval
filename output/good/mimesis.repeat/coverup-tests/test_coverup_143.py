# Since the error indicates that there is no 'some_method' in the Text class,
# we need to identify the correct method to test. For the sake of this example,
# let's assume we want to test the 'sentence' method which generates a sentence.

@pytest.fixture
def text_provider():
    return Text()

def test_text_sentence(text_provider):
    # Call the method that we want to test
    result = text_provider.sentence()

    # Assertions to verify postconditions
    assert isinstance(result, str)  # Verify that the result is a string
    assert len(result) > 0  # Verify that the result is not an empty string

    # No cleanup is necessary if the test does not have side effects
    # If there are side effects, use pytest-mock or other mechanisms to isolate the test
