from mimesis.providers.payment import Payment

# Assuming the Payment class has more methods and attributes that are not shown in the snippet provided.
# The test below is a generic example that should be adapted to the actual methods and attributes of the Payment class.

def test_payment_provider_methods(mocker):
    # Setup
    payment_provider = Payment()

    # Mocking any external dependencies if necessary
    # For example, if Payment class has a method that calls an external API, we should mock the response.
    # mocker.patch('mimesis.providers.payment.external_api_call', return_value='mocked_response')

    # Exercise & Verify
    # Call the methods of Payment class and assert their expected behavior
    # For example, if there is a method `credit_card_number`, we can test it like this:
    # credit_card = payment_provider.credit_card_number()
    # assert isinstance(credit_card, str)
    # assert len(credit_card) == 16  # Assuming credit card numbers are 16 digits long

    # Teardown
    # No teardown needed if we're only testing in-memory objects and mocked responses
    pass

# Note: The above test is a template and should be adapted to the actual methods and attributes of the Payment class.
# Without the full context of the Payment class, it's not possible to write a specific test.
# The test should be placed in a test file, typically named `test_payment.py` or similar.
