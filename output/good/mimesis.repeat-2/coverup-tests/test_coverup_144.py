from mimesis.providers.payment import Payment

# Assuming the Payment class has more methods and attributes that are not shown in the snippet provided.
# The test below is a generic example of how to test a class method that might be missing coverage.

def test_payment_method(mocker):
    # Setup: Create an instance of the Payment class
    payment = Payment()

    # Mock any external dependencies if necessary
    # For example, if Payment class has a method that calls an external service, you would mock it here.
    # mocker.patch('mimesis.providers.payment.external_service_call', return_value='mocked_response')

    # Exercise: Call the method that you want to test
    # Since no specific method is provided, I'm using `some_payment_method` as a placeholder
    # result = payment.some_payment_method()

    # Verify: Check the result to ensure it meets expectations
    # assert result == 'expected_result'

    # Cleanup: No cleanup is necessary if you're not modifying any external state
    pass

# Note: Since the provided code snippet does not contain any actual methods or logic to test,
# the above test function is a template to show how you might structure a test.
# You would need to replace `some_payment_method` with the actual method you want to test
# and adjust the assertions accordingly.
