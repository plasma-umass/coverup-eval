from mimesis.builtins.ru import RussiaSpecProvider

# Since the provided code snippet does not contain any methods or logic to test,
# and the class RussiaSpecProvider is empty, we cannot write a test that improves coverage
# for the given code. The class must have some methods or logic to be tested.

# However, if we assume that the class has some methods that are not shown in the snippet,
# we can write a dummy test function to demonstrate how a test might look.

# Example of a dummy test function for a non-existing method of RussiaSpecProvider
def test_russia_spec_provider_method():
    # Since there are no methods in RussiaSpecProvider, we cannot test anything.
    # This is a placeholder test that always passes.
    assert True

# Please note that the above test is purely illustrative and will not work with the
# actual empty RussiaSpecProvider class as provided in the question.
