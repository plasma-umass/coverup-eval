# Since the provided code snippet does not contain any methods or logic,
# it's not possible to write a test that would improve coverage for the
# snippet itself. However, I can provide a test template for the class
# that can be expanded once methods are added to the USASpecProvider class.

class TestUSASpecProvider:
    def test_placeholder(self, mocker):
        # This is a placeholder test that does nothing.
        # It should be replaced with actual tests once methods are implemented.
        provider = USASpecProvider()
        assert provider is not None

# To run the tests, use the following command:
# pytest test_usa_spec_provider.py
