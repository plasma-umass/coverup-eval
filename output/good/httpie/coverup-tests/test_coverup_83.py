# Corrected test function assuming RequestItems has no method 'existing_method'
def test_request_items_function(mocker):
    # Setup: create a mock and patch the RequestItems class method/attribute if needed
    # Since 'existing_method' does not exist, we should not attempt to patch it.
    # Instead, we can test an actual method of the RequestItems class or skip patching.

    # Instantiate the RequestItems class
    request_items = RequestItems()

    # Call the method or function you want to test
    # Replace 'actual_method' with a real method from RequestItems class
    # result = request_items.actual_method()

    # Assertions to verify postconditions
    # assert result == 'expected_result'

    # No need for cleanup since we did not create any mocks
